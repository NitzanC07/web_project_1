Last update: _4.8.2021_
Project name: _How to Learn_

## Project's description
For this project I used with HTML and CSS.
I made this project as part as my studies for Web Developer course.
I used with some features of HTML like FlexBox, Semantic tags, BEM methodology, Positioning item, Embedding content, animations, forms. 
I combined almost every these features in this project with CSS features.

## Refactor code
The project can be improve to correct the links by adding url path.
The animation of the square in the head section is cancel the 15 degrees rotation, so maybe it is need to fix it.
